        <p>He's had quite an evening. Someone stole his wheelchair. Did you see who it was? Red bearded man. We don't need no education. Yes you do. You've just used a double negative. Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages. I am a man, he's a man, we're men! Ok, tell me how your feeling. I feel delicate... and annoyed, and... I think I'm ugly. Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN! Yeah, you need to turn it on... uh, the button turns it on.

        <p>Oh my God. I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk. He's had quite an evening. Someone stole his wheelchair. Did you see who it was? Red bearded man. I'm a 32 year old IT-man who works in a basement. Yes, I do the whole Lonely Hearts thing! You mean 999. Yes, yes, I mean 999! Yeah, I know. That's the American one, you berk! Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? A story of a young man trying to find his sexuality in the uncaring Thatcher years. Warning: Contains scenes of graphic homoeroticism.
        </p>
        <p>While he was eating, did you hear anyone laughing? Like... in the kitchen area? Yes! Yes I did, actually, yes I did. That'd be trouser food! You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for you! [slams down phone] That told her! Shut up, do what I tell you, I'm not interested; these are just some of the things you'll be hearing if you answer this ad. I'm an idiot and I dont care about anyone but myself. P.S. No dogs! A story of a young man trying to find his sexuality in the uncaring Thatcher years. Warning: Contains scenes of graphic homoeroticism. Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world! I'm going to murder you... You bloody woman!

            It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... No, no there you go, no there you go. I just heard it come on. Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. I'm going to murder you... You bloody woman! Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world!
